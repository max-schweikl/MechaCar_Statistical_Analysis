## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

- When reviewing which variables provided a non-random amount of variance, we can see that "vehicle_weight","spoiler_angle" and "AWD" meet this criteria.
- The slope in this data is not equal to zero, since the p-value is less than zero (or 5.35e-11 to be exact).
- When looking specifically at the R-squared value, we can see this comes out at 0.7149, which means that for roughly 71.49% of the time the predictions in the lineal model will be accurate, which while this is a good confidence indicator, it could stil be higher.
